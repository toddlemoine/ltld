    <p>
      Let the Letter Drop (LTLD) is a game about dropping letters to make words. It's a bit like Tetris, but with
      letters
      instead of blocks. It's a bit like a crossword, but if you were trying to make it while the letters were being
      thrown at you. It can
      be about how much of the board you complete, or how many words you make, or how many big words you make. It's up
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>LTLD is made by Todd Lemoine in Portland, Oregon.</p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
    </a>
    <p>Drop letters on the board to make words and get points. Play for points or try to fill the board. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a letter piece from your tray.</li>
      <li>If you select a piece with more than one letter, you can rotate it before dropping.</li>
      <li>Move it left and right to select a column, then drop it on the board.</li>
      <li>Use the bomb or left- and right- bumper "specials" to remove or move letters on the board.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Desktop: Use Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys to move and rotate. Space or Enter to select and drop.</li>
      <li>Mobile: Use the on-screen controls to move, select, and drop letters and specials.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Daily Mode</h3>
    <p>The Daily mode of LTLD is the default version of the game. You can change to the Freeplay mode at any time from
      the Help screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, everyone gets the same 3 words and the same bag of letters (but randomized for each person).
      The goal is to make all three daily words and then fill up the board with as many words as you can.
      New day, new words and letters. You can play as many times as you want.
    </p>
    <h3>Freeplay Mode</h3>
    <p>Play for yourself. Get a new bag of letters every time you play.</p>
    <p>You can make Freeplay the default mode in the Settings screen. When you visit ltld.fun, it will start in Freeplay
      instead of Daily mode.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
    </a>
    <ol>
      <li>Longer words get more points-per-letter.
        <ul>
          <li>4-letter words: 20 points (5 per letter)</li>
          <li>5-letter words: 50 points (10 per letter)</li>
          <li>6-letter words: 90 points (15 per letter)</li>
          <li>Daily words: Points above + 100 points</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You can make a word multiple times in one board, but you only get points the first time you make it.</li>
      <li>There are a fixed number of pieces and specials for any game, so use them carefully.</li>
      <li>
        For the daily game, you get 50 of the single letters and 20 of the multiple-letter pieces. The letters
        of the daily words are guaranteed to be in the first 35 of the single-letter pieces (the size of the board).
      </li>
      <li>When making the daily words, you have more flexibility if you build up, in a column, and with each word spaced
        a column apart.
        That way, you can always drop letters you can't use in the columns between and then bump them over or blow up as
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>You can "burn" or waste specials by dropping them on columns where they aren't effective. Bombs and bumpers
        dropped on empty columns will blow up.
        Letters on the edge columns, or next to filled columns can't be bumped and the bumper will be used up. Use this
        to cycle through specials
        to get to one you need.</li>
